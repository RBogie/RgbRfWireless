Each signal consists of a sequence of the following high/low periods where each combo represents a bit. The measured periods are around T=400us. The signal consists of 24 bits and a special 'endbit'.
0 = T,3T
1 = 3T,T
End = T,30T

Each code is repeated 5 times.
Since the signal starts with the address directly, it is hard to find the start. Therefore the library needs at least repeat=2 signals, since it watches the end of the previous sequence which is more unique (T,30T).

As can be seen, the above shows that the different buttons seem to differ on the last 5 bits. However, on the observed codes, bit 6-8 are always 0, so my guess is that the button code is 8 bits, and the address is 16bit. If a remote is found where the address is longer than 16bit (proving that the button number is 5) I will change the library, but for now I'll take the easy route and use the assumption of code sizes according to my observations.

Special combos:
Power + Mode+:
  Switches led driver to listen to any remote
Red + blue:
  Switches the color output mode (e.g. RGB to BGR)
Speed+ + Speed-:
  Pairs this remote to the freshly started leddriver (< 5 seconds since power-on)

Each combo results in 1 repeat of both button codes, the order being determined by which button was pressed first. The time between the 2 codes is roughly equal to the time that the user keeps pressing both buttons, but is minimally 30T (however, 100+ms is normal)
